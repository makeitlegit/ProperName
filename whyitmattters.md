# Why It Matters

## Your name means something
Your chosen name is a core part of your identity, and there’s a story behind each part. It is representing you to the world. During your lifetime, you may have traditions or transitions that change your chosen name.

## Your personal name(s) are your individual identity. 
It might be a lightweight choice, such as the nickname you prefer. It might be a religious choice, honoring a community custom or a personal hallmark of faith. It might be a deeply deliberated choice to embrace an identity that fits your soul in a way a name given to you may not. It might be a mark of protest. Whatever it (or they) are, they should be yours.

## Your family name(s) are a connection
It might vary from being a part of different families over the course of parental or guardian changes. It might be a part of the formation or adjustment of families through marriage or union changes. Some people use only a single name and do not add a “family” name at all.

## You may also have an artist name(s) 
Your artist name(s) represent your identity for a body of artistic work.


# Getting it right matters

We’re human. Everyone, at some point, has mispronounced a name, written a name incorrectly, or gotten it entirely wrong. It happens. **e should make the effort to use people’s proper names, and when mistakes happen, help fix them.**

There’s a lot of variety in how these names get mapped to the legal and cultural contexts you may live in – and having your name messed up with these can cause many problems for travel, employment, finances, and government services. A legal name is used for paperwork and processes, but even then it is woefully common to encounter legacy systems that limit what can be entered for a name. **We can make our products and services smarter about people’s names, and create common approaches for fallbacks.**
