# Proper Name Definition

Your chosen name is a core part of your identity, and there’s a story behind each part. It is representing you to the world. During your lifetime, you may have traditions or transitions that change your chosen name. This format is a way to capture the full view of what is accurate for you now.


# Proper Name Fields

**Your proper name are the name(s) for your personal identity.** It might be a lightweight choice, such as the nickname you prefer. It might be a religious choice, honoring a community custom such as baptism, confirmation, conversion, or ordination, or simply adopted as a personal hallmark of faith. It might be a deeply deliberated choice to embrace an identity that fits your soul in a way a name given to you may not. It might be a mark of protest. Whatever it (or they) are, they define you as you which to be seen (which may or may not match a legal name).

## Conversational Name(s)

The name you'd like to be addressed by in casual conversation, such as your [preferred name](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/creating-more-inclusive-and-culturally-sensitive-forms/) or [given name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name). Use this for casual contexts.
> *example*: Hi, Joe!


## Formal Personal Name

The name you'd like to be addressed by in a formal conversation. Use this for professional or ceremonial contexts, which could include "middle" name(s) if appropriate.
> *example*: Please welcome Joseph.


## Family Name

A family name is a connection. It might vary from being a part of different families over the course of parental or guardian changes. It might be a part of the formation or adjustment of families through marriage or union changes. Some people use only a single name and do not add a “family” name at all.

This is also known as a "surname" and it can appear in different places depending on the culture: a "last" name in Western name order, the initial name in Asian name order.


## Prefix

A [prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_family_name_affixes) is used in conjunction with a family name to designate the nature of the connection. In some contexts prefixes are connecting words, like [tussenvoegsels (Dutch Names)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tussenvoegsel) of "van" ("from") and "de" ("the"). While this might appear to be part of the family name, they may not included when sorting alphabetically (especially in their country of origin).


## Suffix

A [suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_(name) is used in conjunction with a family name to designate the relationship to another family member with a similar name. It might be a elder/youth relationship like "Sr." and "Jr.", or a sibling relationship like "II", "III", and so on. The suffix is an important identifier that should always be included along with the family name.


## Family Name Affix

A prefix or suffix used to clarify relationships in conjunction with family names. These can be an ethnic signifier of relationships (like Arabic or Hebrew "bin" for "son of") birth order (Jr., Sr., II, III, IV)


## Heritage Name(s)

The additional names that you may use in formal contexts. This may be multiple family names to reflect a longer familial lineage, a practice that is common in Latiné, Vietnamese, and Arabic cultures. In the Congo, there is a ["post-name"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo_naming_customs) which can represent one or more ancestors, a village, a clan, or a personal attribute.


## Honorific(s) (Ms. Mr. Mx. Mrs. Miss; Dr.; Madam, Dame, Sir, Lady, Lord)

Honorifics are used in formal contexts to add a layer of characteristics or recognition. In cases where there are no honorifics, the gender-neutral honorific Mx. is gaining adoption.

There can be more than one honorific, and there is a specific order for those that appear before names ([pre-nominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-nominal_letters)) and those that appear after them ([post-nominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-nominal_letters)).

> *example*: Please welcome Dr. Knowles.


## Artist Name

**You may also have artist name(s) to represent your identity for a body of artistic work.** Artist Names are used to designate a person's persona and body of work separately from their proper name.

**They might be simplifications**  
> *examples* Joseph Fiennes (Joseph Alberic Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes), Lorde (Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor)

**They might be unique** to sound different than another performer. David Bowie (David Allen Jones) thought his proper name sounded too similar to Davey Jones of The Monkees and named himself after the Bowie knife. David Tennant (David John McDonald) needed a unique name to be part of the Actors' Guild and named himself after Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys.

**They may change over time**, like Puff Daddy (sometimes Puffy) to P. Diddy to Diddy to Love (aka Brother Love) (Sean Love Combs).

**They may be the only one shown publicly** to avoid the association with their work known by their proper name, such as Nicolas Cage (Nicholas Kim Coppola) avoiding the limelight of his uncle Francis Ford Coppola. Sometimes this is a closely guarded secret, such as Richard Bachman (revealed to be a pen name of Steven King).


# Ways to describe your name

In addition to the fields themselves, there should be a field for an optional written or spoken pronunciation guide.

- **Add a URL** to an audio or video file where you speak your name; see [Resources](https://github.com/makeitlegit/propername/blob/main/resources.md) for services that support this.

- **Describe soundalike words** from common words; see the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/grammar/key-to-pronunciation) or [The Free Dictionary](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/_/pk_ipa.htm) for ideas.  

> *example*: Stephen, sounds like “even”

- **Use phonemes** to describe your name by syllable using [pronunciation symbols](https://www.infoplease.com/key-pronunciation-symbols) similar to those used in a dictionary.  

> *example*: Stephen \ ste-fän’ \

- **Spell letters** that differentiate common spellings of your name; use a [spelling alphabet](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/military-phonetic-alphabet-3356942) like this one used by NATO and the US military.

> *example*: Stefan, with an F as in Foxtrot
