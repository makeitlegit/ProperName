# Proper Name Definition

Your proper name is a core part of your identity, and there’s a story behind each part. It is representing you to the world. 

During your lifetime, you may have multiple traditions or transitions that change your proper name:

- *A nickname* you prefer. 
- *A family adjustment* through parental or guardian changes. 
- *A religious choice* to honor a community custom (baptism, confirmation, conversion, ordination) or a personal hallmark of faith. 
- *A personal choice* to embrace an identity that fits your soul in a way a name given to you may not.
- *A formation of family* through a marriage or union.
- *A mark of recognition* of educational achievement or bestowed honor.

This format is a way to capture the full view of what is accurate for you *now*. Whatever it is, it defines you as you wish to be seen at this time, regardless of your legal name. Some of these might not be used; some of these might be used but have multiple valid names that could be used for them. Additionally, the order of how your names are presented can depending on the cultural context.


# Proper Name Fields


## Personal Name

This is the name you use to represent yourself as an individual ("first name").

### personal-use

An individual name for common use, such as in conversation ("preferred name", "chosen name", "given name"). 

> *example*: "Hi, Pat!"

### personal-document

An individual name for document/system/legal matches, if different than your personal-use name.


## Heritage Name

This is a name you may use in addition to personal and family names (such as "middle name").

This may be extended family names to reflect a longer familial lineage, a practice that is common in Latiné, Vietnamese, and Arabic cultures. In the Congo, there is a ["post-name"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo_naming_customs) which can represent one or more ancestors, a village, a clan, or a personal attribute.

### heritage-use: 
An additional name for personal use.

### heritage-document:
An additional name for document/system/legal matches, if different than your heritage-use name.


## Family Name

This is the name you use for a family assocation ("last name", "surname"). 

It may include common connecting words to indicate the role of other parts of the name, like [tussenvoegsels (Dutch Names)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tussenvoegsel). While this might appear to be part of the family name, they may not included when sorting alphabetically in their country of origin so consider that for internationalization.

> *example*: "van" in the artist Vincent Van Gogh, "de la" in the designer Oscar De La Renta, "bin" and "al-" in the mathematician Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi. 

It may include common suffixes (Sr, Jr, II, III, etc.) that are specific to that individual and should be disregarded for searches and family groupings. 

> *example*: Musician/actor Harry Connick, Jr. should be found by a search of "Connick", and is a part of the family "Connick".

### family-use

A family name for common use, such as in conversation. 

> *example*: "Hi, Dr. Halsey!"

### family-document

A family name for document/system/legal matches, if different than your family-use name.


## Title
