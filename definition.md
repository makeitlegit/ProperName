# Proper Name Definition

Your proper name is a core part of your identity, and there’s a story behind each part. It is representing you to the world. 

During your lifetime, you may have multiple traditions or transitions that change your proper name:

- *A nickname* you prefer. 
- *A family adjustment* through parental or guardian changes. 
- *A religious choice* to honor a community custom (baptism, confirmation, conversion, ordination) or a personal hallmark of faith. 
- *A personal choice* to embrace an identity that fits your soul in a way a name given to you may not.
- *A formation of family* through a marriage or union.
- *A mark of recognition* of educational achievement or bestowed honor.

This format is a way to capture the full view of what is accurate for you *now*. Whatever it is, it defines you as you wish to be seen at this time, regardless of your legal name.


# Proper Name Fields

## Conversational Name(s)

The name you'd like to be addressed by in casual conversation, such as your [preferred name](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/creating-more-inclusive-and-culturally-sensitive-forms/) or [given name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name). Use this for casual contexts.


## Formal Personal Name

The name you'd like to be addressed by in a formal conversation. Use this for professional or ceremonial contexts, which could include "middle" name(s) if appropriate.


## Family Name

A family name is a connection that can change over a lifetime. Some people use only a single name and do not add a “family” name at all.

This is also known as a "surname" and it can appear in different places depending on the culture: a "last" name in Western name order, the initial name in Asian name order.


## Prefix

A [prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_family_name_affixes) is used in conjunction with a family name to designate the nature of the connection. In some contexts prefixes are connecting words, like [tussenvoegsels (Dutch Names)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tussenvoegsel) of "van" ("from") and "de" ("the"). While this might appear to be part of the family name, they may not included when sorting alphabetically (especially in their country of origin).


## Suffix

A [suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_(name) is used in conjunction with a family name to designate the relationship to another family member with a similar name. It might be a elder/youth relationship like "Sr." and "Jr.", or a sibling relationship like "II", "III", and so on. The suffix is an important identifier that should always be included along with the family name.


## Heritage Name(s)

The additional names that you may use in formal contexts. This may be multiple family names to reflect a longer familial lineage, a practice that is common in Latiné, Vietnamese, and Arabic cultures. In the Congo, there is a ["post-name"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo_naming_customs) which can represent one or more ancestors, a village, a clan, or a personal attribute.


## Honorific(s) (Ms. Mr. Mx. Mrs. Miss; Dr.; Madam, Dame, Sir, Lady, Lord)

Honorifics are used in formal contexts to add a layer of characteristics or recognition. In cases where there are no honorifics, the gender-neutral honorific Mx. is gaining adoption.

There can be more than one honorific, and there is a specific order for those that appear before names ([pre-nominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-nominal_letters)) and those that appear after them ([post-nominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-nominal_letters)).



# Ways to describe your name

In addition to the fields themselves, there should be a field for an optional written or spoken pronunciation guide.

- **Add a URL** to an audio or video file where you speak your name; see [Resources](https://github.com/makeitlegit/propername/blob/main/resources.md) for services that support this.

- **Describe soundalike words** from common words; see the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/grammar/key-to-pronunciation) or [The Free Dictionary](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/_/pk_ipa.htm) for ideas.  

> *example*: Stephen, sounds like “even”

- **Use phonemes** to describe your name by syllable using [pronunciation symbols](https://www.infoplease.com/key-pronunciation-symbols) similar to those used in a dictionary.  

> *example*: Stephen \ ste-fän’ \

- **Spell letters** that differentiate common spellings of your name; use a [spelling alphabet](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/military-phonetic-alphabet-3356942) like this one used by NATO and the US military.

> *example*: Stefan, with an F as in Foxtrot
