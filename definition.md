# Proper Name Definition

Your chosen name is a core part of your identity, and there’s a story behind each part. It is representing you to the world. During your lifetime, you may have traditions or transitions that change your chosen name. This format is a way to capture the full view of what is accurate for you now.

## How the fields are used

In addition to the fields themselves, each field should allow for two optional clarifications:
- written pronunciation guide (see “Ways to describe your name” for ideas)
- preferred spelling for use for limited systems (ASCII) ...or should this be made visible on the front end? Should exceptions be storable, kinda like 1Password?

# Fields

## Personal Name

**Your personal name(s) are your individual identity.** It might be a lightweight choice, such as the nickname you prefer. It might be a religious choice, honoring a community custom or a personal hallmark of faith. It might be a deeply deliberated choice to embrace an identity that fits your soul in a way a name given to you may not. It might be a mark of protest. Whatever it (or they) are, they should be yours.
**
### Conversational Name(s) (or Preferred Name)

The name you'd like to be addressed by in casual conversation. Use this for casual contexts.
> *example*: Hi, Joe!

### Formal Personal Name

The name you'd like to be addressed by in a formal conversation. Use this for professional or ceremonial contexts.
> *example*: Please welcome Joseph.

### Full Personal Name

The name that is on legal/canonical identification. **This name should be kept private, and only shown to users in the context of legal verification.**


## Family Name

**Your family name(s) are a connection.** It might vary from being a part of different families over the course of parental or guardian changes. It might be a part of the formation or adjustment of families through marriage or union changes. Some people use only a single name and do not add a “family” name at all.

### Current Family Name



### Extended Family Name(s)

### Heritage Name(s)

### Honorific(s) (Ms. Mr. Mx. Mrs. Miss; Dr.; Madam, Dame, Sir, Lady, Lord)


## Artist Name

**You may also have artist name(s) to represent your identity for a body of artistic work.** Artist Names are used to designate a person's persona and body of work separately from their proper name.

### Artist Name(s)

**They might be simplifications**  
> *examples* Joseph Fiennes (Joseph Alberic Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes), Lorde (Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor)

**They might be unique** to sound different than another performer. David Bowie (David Allen Jones) thought his proper name sounded too similar to Davey Jones of The Monkees and named himself after the Bowie knife. David Tennant (David John McDonald) needed a unique name to be part of the Actors' Guild and named himself after Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys.

**They may change over time**, like Puff Daddy (sometimes Puffy) to P. Diddy to Diddy to Love (aka Brother Love) (Sean Love Combs).

**They may be the only one shown publicly** to avoid the association with their work known by their proper name, such as Nicolas Cage (Nicholas Kim Coppola) avoiding the limelight of his uncle Francis Ford Coppola. Sometimes this is a closely guarded secret, such as Richard Bachman (revealed to be a pen name of Steven King).


## Ways to describe your name

- **Add a URL** to an audio or video file where you speak your name.
- **Describe soundalike words** from common words; see the Oxford English Dictionary or The Free Dictionary for ideas.  
> example: Stephen, sounds like “even”
- **Use phonemes** to describe your name by syllable using pronunciation symbols similar to those used in a dictionary  
> example: Stephen \ ste-fän’ \
- **Spell letters** that differentiate common spellings of your name; use a spelling alphabet like this one used by NATO and the US military.  
> example: Stefan, with an F as in Foxtrot
